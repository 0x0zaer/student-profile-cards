Instructions:
1. Basic Layout:

    Create an index.html file for the structure.
    Create a style.css file for styling.
    Use a div container to wrap both cards.
    Ensure both cards are displayed side by side using CSS (flexbox or grid).

        The college name.
        The university name.
        The degree/program of study.
