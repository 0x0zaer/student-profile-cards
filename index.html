                <p><strong>Short description:</strong> I began my journey at the Konoha Ninja Academy, graduating at
                    just 7, becoming one of the youngest prodigies in history. Trained by my father and joining the Anbu
                    at 11, I honed my skills in espionage and combat. Mastering the Sharingan and Mangeky≈ç Sharingan, I
                    created techniques like Tsukuyomi, Amaterasu, and Susanoo. My true education, however, came from my
                    sacrifices and the burden of protecting the village, leaving behind a legacy shaped by both wisdom
                    and tragedy</p>
